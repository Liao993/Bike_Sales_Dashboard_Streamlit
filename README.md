## **Introduction and Goal**

This interactive dashboard examines 100,000 bike sales transactions to create an interactive dashboard. By analyzing customer demographics, sales year, and regional performance, it aims to reveal key sales trends and top-performing categories. The resulting insights can support strategic decision-making for stakeholders in the bike store chain.

## **Process and Tools**

This project leverages key tools like Pandas for data processing, Streamlit for creating an interactive dashboard, and Plotly for dynamic data visualizations. This project highlights my proficiency in data analysis, interactive web development, and advanced visualization techniques, demonstrating my ability to deliver professional, data-driven solutions.
